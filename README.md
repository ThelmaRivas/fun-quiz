# Fun Quiz

## Description

This weeks project has the goal of learning how to use web APIS by manipulating the DOM. The project consists of a basic quiz about JavaScript that the user is supposed to answer and at the end of the quiz, the user is asked for its initials so they webpage can save his/her final score. This weeks challenge helps you get used to JavaScript and how the APIS work, in this case we use a lot of new properties like: setAttribute, createElement, getElementbyId, Time Intervals, Events Listener, AppendChild, LocalStorage, DataAttributes, EventBubbling and Preventing default. A big issue I encounter while doing the project was using in the correct way and order the logic javascript properties as well as establishing the variables, id's and classes on the html element. 

## Usage

On the repository you find 2 folder: Assets and Develop. In the assets hold the images used in the project as well as the screenshot of the Github Pages. In the develop folder you can find the html files and another assets folder where the css and js files can be found. There are 3 javascript files: questions.js that contains the variable questions with title, multiple choices and the correct answer, scores.js that is in charge of saving all the user's highscores and logic.js that holds all the functionality of the website (quiz). 

When the browser uploads, then the user finds a start screen and a button that says start quiz, when the user clicks on the start quiz button then the timer starts counting and the first question is display. The user needs to choose between the 4 multiple choice, if the user gets the correct answer then a feedback message is display saying "correct" if the user get it wrong, then the display message says "wrong" and punish the user with -15 seconds of the timer. When the user finish the quiz, then the website asks for his/her initials so their highscores can be saved.
